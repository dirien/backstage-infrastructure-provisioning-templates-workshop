# How To Add Infrastructure Provisioning to Your Backstage Templates

Software templates in Backstage are vital for bootstrapping new projects, effectively reducing startup time and masking
complexities. When provisioning infrastructure, questions arise on modeling both day-1 and day-2 operations and ensuring
compliance with security and company policies.

In this interactive workshop, I will lead participants through these essential concepts. We'll explore how to integrate
infrastructure provisioning into software templates and provide a detailed walkthrough of a reference implementation,
including day-2 operations.

By the end, attendees will:

- Understand the benefits of provisioning with Backstage
- Identify challenges in provisioning infrastructure in templates
- Apply best practices through Backstage
- Automate continuous delivery and verification of changes using GitOps with Pulumi
- Build self-service enabled software templates in Backstage
